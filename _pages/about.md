**Akira Keene Teotrakool** is an undergraduate at Grinnell College studying Political Science. A Class Researcher of Transnational Digital Cultures, their research is informed by political psychology, economic sociology, and critical media studies to examine class identity and affect in urban youth cultures across Southeast Asia. Their research focuses on two primary projects: the first, "Educational Sequencing as Class Strategy," investigates how decisions to pursue higher education abroad (undergraduate vs. graduate) affect the formation of social capital and the reproduction of class among Thai international students in the U.S.; the second project, "Subcultural Economies of Addictive Glamorization," explores Thai urban identity formation, with a component titled "Addictive Glamorization: Enterprising Influencers and the Reimagining of Thai Urban Identity through Aspirational Femininity" presented at the Influencer and Gender Politics in South East Asia Symposium (2025). 

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
